  description: "Looking at all three metrics, we observed that the variant A performs significantly worse than the other variants.
We observe a slightly better performance for variant B when looking at listening time and number of likes, but the difference is not statistically significant. The effect on retention is unclear, as we observe a strong positive effect when looking at the whole period of the experiment, but not when focusing on the activity of users at the end of the experiment. Furthermore, I am wondering why the two control variables differ (e.g. when looking at listening time).",
