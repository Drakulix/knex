Study about time between events to define an appropriate inactivity threshold for sessions:
- Time between Events
- Differences in Sessions depending on Timeout Threshold 
- Sessions Characteristics

Data:
- Platforms: all
- Time Period: xxx
- Sample: xxx users per platform
- Events: Listens, Clicks, Pageviews
 
Insights:
- We decided to use a threshold of xxx across all platforms.
- We did not identify a significant difference between sessions based on differen types of user IDs.
- Defining a threshold in the range of xxx to xxx does not change the structure of the sessions significantly.
