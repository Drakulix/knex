  "description": "We explore the use of song lyrics for automatic indexing of music. Using lyrics mined from the Web we apply a standard text processing technique to characterize their semantic content. We then determine artist similarity in this space. We found lyrics can be used to discover natural genre clusters. Experiments on a publicly available set of 399 artists showed that determining artist similarity using lyrics is better than random but inferior to a state-of-the-art acoustic similarity technique. However, the approaches made different errors, suggesting they could be profitably combined.",
