        description     :    'Recommendation systems exist to help users discover content in a large body of items. An ideal recommendation system should mimic the actions of a trusted friend or expert, producing a personalised collection of recommendations that balance between the desired goals of accuracy, diversity, novelty and serendipity. We introduce the Auralist recommendation framework, a system that – in contrast to previouswork – attempts to balance and improve all four factors simultaneously. Using a collection of novel algorithms inspired by principles of ‘serendipitous discovery’, we demonstrate a method of successfully injecting serendipity, novelty and diversity into recommendations whilst limiting the impact on accuracy. We evaluate Auralist quantitatively over a broad set of metrics and, with a user study on music recommendation, show that Auralist’s emphasis on serendipity indeed improves user satisfaction.',
