  "description": "Overall listening time on Android increases and there is an overall increase in Shares. 
However, there is a downturn in stream shares which implies that new-stream users are using other features (instead of the stream) to share content.
Daily shares on stream decreases by -5%. Partly this is due to the fact that users switch to other features, because new links on stream direct them to these features. The remaining change in shares remains unclear.
