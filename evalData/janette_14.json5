  description: "We analyze the relationship of track policy changes and the listening behavior of users. 
First, we look at track policy characteristics in general and investigate when and how often policies are changing. We observe, for instance, that x% of snippetized tracks become fully available after x. Then, we look at the impact of such changes on users listening behavior.",
