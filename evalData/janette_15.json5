We analyse how the release of SoundCloud Go in the US impacted user activity, more precisely: listening, retention, engagement.
1. We characterise users that converted
- highligy engaged?
- LT per user
- Likes, followings, playlists
- Reposts / shares
- What do they listen to normally (collection, stream, etc.)
- Collecting vs. visiting ratio on sessions
- App 
- Region
- Gender
- Age of their account
2. Diversity of their listening (distinct tracks, disctint genres, distinct artists)
3. Did they behaviour changed? 
- how is listening habits change, because users have more content + offline sync now (time of day listening, auto/manual listening)
- More tracks adding
- More different artists listening
- More listening in general
- Active days (retention)
- More listening on specific features (e.g. search, or collection)?
- Offline sync usage vs. normal usage
- time of day listening
4. Are these users more engaged or less engaged than before?
- If engagement is increasing, does it increase faster as the engagement of users that do not subscribe (e.g. maybe compare with users from different that have same level of engagement)
- Auto vs. manual listening
