The `svg`-files in the current folder are in *plain*-`svg` and should be used for productive environment.

The files in the subfolder `./originals` are the base `svg`-files of the knex logo. The original `svg`'s are created with *Inkscape*, because of this they are in a special `svg`-format and should not be used in a productive environment. (maybe incompatible)
